# Bug Fixes Summary - Escape Placement Cell Game

## üêõ **Critical Bugs Identified & Fixed**

### 1. **Aptitude Test Evaluation Bug** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Correct answers were showing as incorrect
**Root Cause**: Evaluation function was using fixed `aptitudeQuestions` array instead of the randomized `selectedQuestions`
**Solution**: 
- Modified `evaluateAptitudeTest()` to accept `selectedQuestions` parameter
- Updated `AptitudeTest.jsx` to pass the actual selected questions to evaluation
- Now correctly evaluates answers against the displayed questions

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// OLD (Buggy)
const correctAnswers = answers.filter((answer, index) => {
  const question = aptitudeQuestions[index]; // Wrong! Uses fixed array
  return question && answer === question.correctAnswer;
});

// NEW (Fixed)
export const evaluateAptitudeTest = (answers, selectedQuestions) => {
  const correctAnswers = answers.filter((answer, index) => {
    const question = selectedQuestions[index]; // Correct! Uses actual questions
    return question && answer === question.correctAnswer;
  });
}
```

### 2. **Coding Challenge Evaluation Bug** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: All tests failing despite correct factorial implementations
**Root Cause**: Evaluation logic was too simplistic and only checked for JavaScript patterns
**Solution**:
- Enhanced `evaluateCodingChallenge()` with language-specific pattern matching
- Added comprehensive factorial logic detection
- Implemented proper base case checking
- Added support for all languages (Python, Java, C++, C)

**Enhanced Logic**:
- **Python**: Checks for `def factorial`, return statement, and factorial logic
- **Java**: Checks for method signature with `long` return type and logic
- **C/C++**: Checks for function declaration and implementation patterns
- **Base Cases**: Detects `n == 0`, `n <= 1`, `n < 2` patterns
- **Factorial Logic**: Detects multiplication, recursion, loops with multiplication

### 3. **Visual Improvements - Coding Lab** üé® ‚Üí ‚úÖ IMPROVED
**Problem**: Excessive neon effects made monitor/keyboard/mouse hard to see
**Solution**:
- Reduced emissive intensity from 1.2+ to 0.6 or lower
- Made monitor, keyboard, and mouse clearly visible
- Kept subtle gaming accents without overwhelming brightness
- Improved text readability on screens
- Better color balance between functionality and aesthetics

## üß™ **Testing Results**

### Aptitude Test
- ‚úÖ Random question selection works correctly
- ‚úÖ Correct answers now properly evaluated
